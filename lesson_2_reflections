What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? It creates a hidden file structure that allows storage of a repository.  It needs to happen because it is not the default.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? It is a temporary working space that is not fixed and allows for flexible review before making a committed commit.
