When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?  you would use a remote repository with collaborative projects when ready access by multiple parties was needed.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  You might always want to do it manually, so that you don't have changes on your master branch eliminated before you have a chance to organize them or push them.  You may also want to review the new commit on the remote to ensure it has desired changes.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?  Forks are like branches off of another repository on GitHub, which start as new repositories in your account.  It would be a way to work off someone else's code and giving them credit, without deranging their original work.  Clones are copies of repositories on that are local, either from GitHub or a local repository.  We would use this when we want to start on work related to an existing project with the potential to send back this information to the source repository.  Branches are like a code development division, where a particular commit takes the code in a different direction.  We would use this when we have a repository, but want to experiment with or work with a subset of code in a direction that may be different from the master.
