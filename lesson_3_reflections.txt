When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?  you would use a remote repository with collaborative projects when ready access by multiple parties was needed.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  You might always want to do it manually, so that you don't have changes on your master branch eliminated before you have a chance to organize them or push them.  You may also want to review the new commit on the remote to ensure it has desired changes.
